# Tight-Analysis-of-EDCS

This repository contains the supplementary code for the paper **Bipartite Matching in Massive Graphs: A Tight Analysis of EDCS**, which will appear at ICML 2024. In this paper, we present a tight analysis of EDCS, a versatile matching sparsifier, in bipartite graphs. We show that, surprisingly, EDCS achieves a strictly better than 2/3-approximation with certain parameters.
